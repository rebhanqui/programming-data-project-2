    "To Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly for the past 800,000 years to the present day.\n",
    "To examine the change in the polar-ice coverage alongside this.\n",

    "In gathering this information and data I will fuse and analyse the data using pandas dataframes and export the results to csv and json formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be anaylising the data, the trends, the relationships between them including but not limited to: temporal leads, lags, and frequencies. I will also use synthesised data to predict global temperature anomoly over the next few decades and compare to published models of the same to see if atmospherice CO2 trends continue and comment on the accelerated warming based on the latest features with temperatures polar-ice coverage and ocean and sea levels."
