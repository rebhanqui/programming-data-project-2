# Programming Data Project 2
Second project for Programming for Data Analysis Module on Climate Change

## Overview

This project analyzes historical climate data to examine trends in temperature anomalies, CO2 concentrations, and CH4 concentrations over time. The analysis includes moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and reveal long-term trends. The data is visualized using various plots, including line plots with dual y-axes.

## Data

The dataset includes:

Temperature Anomalies: Historical deviations in temperature from a reference period.
CO2 Concentrations: Historical measurements of atmospheric CO2 levels.
CH4 Concentrations: Historical measurements of atmospheric CH4 levels.

### Requirements

Python 3.x
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Install the required libraries using pip:

`pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`
