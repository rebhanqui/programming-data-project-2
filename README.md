# Programming Data Project 2
Second project for Programming for Data Analysis Module on Climate Change

## Overview

This project analyzes historical climate data to examine trends in temperature anomalies, rainfall anomalies, CO2 concentrations, and CH4 concentrations over time. The analysis includes moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and reveal long-term trends. The data is visualized using various plots, including line plots with dual y-axes.

## Data

*The various final datasets and plots include:*

### Global Data

- Temperature Anomalies: Historical deviations in temperature.
- Rainfall Anomalies: Historical deviations in rainfall.
- CO2 Concentrations: Historical measurements of atmospheric CO2 levels.
- CH4 Concentrations: Historical measurements of atmospheric CH4 levels.

### Irish Data

- Temperature Anomalies: Historical deviations in temperature.
- Rainfall Anomalies: Historical deviations in rainfall.
  
### For Both

- Running Averages showing a clearer picture
- Specific chunks of time showing even more detail


### Requirements

- requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch data.
- io: For handling in-memory streams, particularly useful for reading data.
- IPython: For rich display capabilities in Jupyter notebooks.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Install the required libraries using pip:

`pip install requests pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn ipython`
